# NQueenGA

solving N Queen problem with genetic algorithm.
Our population will have N*10 solutions which initialized randomly.
We choose N*4 best solutions which will give us N*2 children.
In mutation function we will change the rows of two queens in different columns with each other.
we will generate 60 generations if we could not find an answer then we will initialize our population once again and start over.
